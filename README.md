# OperativeSystem
University project made with 2 other programmers

I will not update this code, it may have some strange behaviour so execute at your own risk

This was made for the operating systems class it's a simplified shell with limited functions, there's also some scripts that are simple tests that where used for showing the functionlity of the code and test the speed and verify the results.
